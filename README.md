# Sign-up-form

## Description of the Project
For this Project i had to build up a form as close as possible to the one The Odin Project assigned.[Check it](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png).

We had to get different Input and make sure that the user use these input in the best way as possible (for example don't put number in "name" input).

## Struggles Point
The first struggle point was to build the actual skeleton of the page. Resizing images and text according to the window dimension took me a while. The whole page shouldn't be responsive but, resizing the window, I should have kept the different pieces in the same position, don't making all the items floating on top of each other.
The most difficult part anyway was to validate every single field. I try to customize the pop up message that the browser generates automatically, but I couldn't go further the use of the title attribute. I've also created a div with a class error able to display if the input was valid or not, through the use of Javascript.
## Conclusion
I realize that building form in the right way is crucial for the user,and for who is collecting datas. 
I definetly should keep an eye on the quality of the code and start to use general variable for CSS to keep track of the color's palette of the page.
